  <h1 id= 'font-face'>My name is Huy</h1>
  <p id= 'font-face'> Huy Nguyen <br> Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam </p>
  <p id= 'font-face'> Hey, I'm aware that a lengthy portfolio won't help me land a job, so fasten your seatbelt cause this gonna be quick!! </p>
  <p id= 'font-face'> During daytime, I'm a creative who loves working with marketing ideas, plans, graphics, and video editing. When Iâ€™m tired, [these places](https://www.notion.so/7d8f76ce5a5d4ec7a69179d9cddda128?pvs=21) are where I sleep overnight.</p>
  <p id= 'font-face'>On social media, I love being low-key, so my boss criticized me for using a clone account to take part in [our campaign.](https://www.tuongan.com.vn/vi/tin-tuc-tuong-an/bo-tranh-12-thang-cat-tuong-an-khang-cham-cam-xuc-nguoi-xem.html) But Iâ€™m not scared, I also join [this one](https://www.facebook.com/groups/116488476823457) without being noticed (learned some electrical skills, worth!!). Furthermore, while stalking how many likes my [social posts](https://www.facebook.com/LiptonTeaVietnam) get, my eyes sometimes get dry, so I decide to read my [other posts](https://www.facebook.com/santen.santen.vn) on how to cure it.</p>
  <p id= 'font-face'>So it is short, right? ðŸ¥² </p>
